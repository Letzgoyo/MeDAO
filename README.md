# Magic Eden $ME DAO Proposal

## Overview

Welcome to the proposal for the **Magic Eden $ME Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, a community-driven governance framework designed to enhance decentralization, foster innovation, and empower the Magic Eden ecosystem. This DAO leverages the $ME token to enable token holders to propose, vote on, and fund initiatives that advance Magic Eden’s mission of supporting cross-chain NFT trading and Web3 decentralized applications (DApps).

The $ME DAO introduces a **3-tier governance structure** (Team, Business Development (BD) Tier, Community) to ensure clear communication, robust proposal refinement, and inclusive decision-making. The BD Tier is explicitly designed as an independent layer, free from favoritism or insider influence, to prioritize the community, token, DAO, and business success. This repository outlines the DAO’s vision, structure, technical implementation, and roadmap for community feedback and deployment.

## **Vision and Objectives**

The $ME DAO aims to decentralize governance of the Magic Eden ecosystem, empowering $ME token holders to shape its future. Key objectives include:

- **Community Empowerment:** Enable token holders to propose and vote on initiatives, such as protocol upgrades, treasury allocations, and partnerships.
- **Transparency:** Ensure all decisions and funds are managed on-chain, building trust through verifiable processes.
- **Innovation:** Fund and support cross-chain NFT protocols and Web3 DApps.
- **Clarity and Fairness:** Use a 3-tier structure with an independent BD Tier to refine proposals, reduce misunderstandings, and prevent favoritism.

## **Governance Structure**

The $ME DAO adopts a **3-tier governance model** to streamline communication and ensure equitable decision-making:

1. **Team Tier:**
   - Comprises Magic Eden core developers, protocol experts, and ecosystem stewards.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Develop initial ideas, technical plans, and strategic proposals (e.g., protocol upgrades, integrations with Solana, Polygon, Ethereum, Bitcoin).
     - Pitch proposals to the BD Tier for refinement.
   - Ensures alignment with Magic Eden’s technical and strategic goals.

2. **Business Development (BD) Tier:**
   - A fully independent layer of community-elected members with expertise in communication, marketing, and Web3 ecosystems, designed to avoid favoritism or insider influence.
   - **Independence Mechanisms:**
     - Members are elected through a transparent, merit-based process using $ME token votes, with no affiliations to Team or Community insiders.
     - Term limits (e.g., 6 months) and performance reviews ensure accountability.
     - A conflict-of-interest policy prohibits BD members from favoring friends or personal networks, prioritizing the DAO’s success, token value, and community benefit.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Collaborate with the Team to refine proposals into clear, detailed content (e.g., whitepapers, infographics, videos).
     - Present polished proposals to the Community for voting, ensuring accessibility and neutrality.
     - Address community questions impartially to prevent confusion and build trust.
   - Focuses on supporting the community, token, DAO, and business without bias.

3. **Community Tier:**
   - Includes all $ME token holders, with voting power proportional to their holdings (subject to quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance).
   - Responsibilities:
     - Review and vote on proposals presented by the BD Tier via a user-friendly voting platform.
     - Provide feedback to the BD Tier to shape future proposals.
   - Ensures broad participation.

### Governance Principles
- **Transparency:** All proposals, votes, and treasury transactions are recorded on-chain, accessible via a public dashboard.
- **Inclusivity:** Quadratic voting ensures smaller token holders have a voice.
- **Neutrality:** The BD Tier’s independence prevents favoritism, ensuring decisions benefit the entire ecosystem.
- **Efficiency:** The BD Tier streamlines communication to balance speed with clarity.

## **Proposal Process**

The $ME DAO’s proposal process ensures clarity, fairness, and impartiality, leveraging the 3-tier structure:

1. **Proposal Submission (Team Tier):**
   - Team members draft proposals, including objectives, budget, timeline, and technical details.
   - Proposals are submitted to the BD Tier for review.

2. **Refinement and Communication (BD Tier):**
   - The BD Tier, acting independently, collaborates with the Team to refine proposals into detailed, accessible content (e.g., summaries, FAQs, visual aids).
   - Refined proposals are published on a dedicated platform (e.g., a $ME DAO website or Snapshot integration) and shared via Discord, Twitter, and other channels.
   - The BD Tier hosts AMAs or forums to address community questions neutrally, ensuring clarity and trust.

3. **Community Voting (Community Tier):**
   - Token holders vote on proposals using $ME tokens via a secure, on-chain voting system.
   - Voting period: 7 days, with a quorum requirement (e.g., 10% of circulating $ME tokens).
   - Quadratic voting ensures equitable influence.

4. **Execution:**
   - Approved proposals are executed by the Team, with funds released from the DAO treasury via smart contracts.
   - Progress updates are shared transparently with the Community.

## **Technical Implementation**
